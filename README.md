# Magic Rolling Ball Application

This is a simple HTML5 Canvas application in which a ball moves by alternating its color between blue and red in each line. The speed can be controlled via a slider, with a default value set to 5.

## Features

- **Canvas Size**: 405 x 405
- **Pattern**: Alternating red and blue colors
- **Control**: A slider to adjust the speed (range: 1-20, step: 1)

## How to Use

1. Open `animation.html` in a browser.
2. The ball starts moving in blue color and changes its color to red as it drops on the next line in alternate manner.
3. Use the slider to change the speed between 1 and 20.
4. The canvas will automatically execute the speed as you change the slider value.
   
## File Structure

- **animation.html**: The HTML file containing the canvas and slider options.
- **animation.js**: The JavaScript file that aids in the movement of the ball and handles user input
   
## Installation

2. Open `animation.html` in any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. No additional dependencies are required.

## Example Output
